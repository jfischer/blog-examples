File Walker

This is a simple test program implemented in multiple languages.

WORK IN PROGRESS...


Test Cases
==========
To test the program, the directory tree should have the following
files/directories:

1. Multiple sub-directories with files
2. Softlinks to files (counted as files)
3. Softlinks to directories (counted as files, should not follow the link)
4. Directories with no access (counted as errors)
5. Files with bad unicode characters (should be counted as errors, but aren't!)
